# UX: INITIAL RESEARCH

# Defining The Problem

Israel boasts the **second-largest collection of fledgling tech companies in the world**, after Silicon Valley.
Over the past decade, 7,000 tech companies have been founded in Israel, where high-tech goods and services account for 12.5% of GDP.
BUT only 30 Arab-led tech firms, the majority of them in software, are making money.

"A fifth of the population, Israel’s 1.7 million Arabs, are only marginal participants in Start-Up Nation. **Only 2% of Israeli technology workers are Arab**."

### Why?

- #### **Scarce funding**

Access to funding from private sources is the biggest challenge.
Most Israeli Arabs, Muslim and Christian, live in the north and the interior, not in greater Tel Aviv, where the global tech companies, startups, and Investors are concentrated.
Nazareth is a 90-minute drive from Tel Aviv; it is not on the radar of most investors.
Arabic investors prefer more traditional ventures, such as Real Estate.

- #### **Entrenched discrimination**

There is no legal guarantee of full equality for Jewish and Arab citizens.
It has been described as "institutionalised discrimination".  
"Palestinians face systematic discrimination merely because of their race, ethnicity, and national origin, depriving them of electricity, water, schools, and access to roads, while nearby Jewish settlers enjoy all of these state-provided benefits" -- *Human Rights Watch, 2010*.

"Today relations between Israel’s Arabs and Jews are as tense as they’ve been in years"

Source="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-26/what-its-like-to-run-an-arab-tech-startup-in-israel#r=hpt-ls"

- #### **Cultural**

There is a narrow vision of professional success among the Arab population.
Israeli Arab children go to schools that are different from and usually inferior to those of their Jewish peers.
A young Israeli Arab who shows promise in school is often expected to become a doctor or, perhaps, a lawyer.
This is because Israel’s Arabs are poorer and therefore less able to absorb a setback. So startups are seen as too risky.
There’s fear of the government and whether it will hinder Arab-owned businesses. There’s fear of banks and the sense that they won’t lend money to Arabs. There’s “fear of being the first,” since there have yet to be any major Arab tech success stories. And there’s fear of being on one’s own, without peers or mentors.

- #### **No military service**

Few Arabs engage in military service, which is a primary source of innovation in Israel.
Israeli Jews have the opportunity to learn tech skills and find likeminded people to collaborate with during their time in the military.
The arab population is cut out of this closed loop.
"A disproportionate number of the nation’s startups have come out of elite intelligence units, which select young men and women for their smarts and technological skills, train them extensively, then release them into the workforce in their mid-20s. Israeli Arabs are exempt from the draft, and most don’t volunteer, feeling that doing so would effectively be taking up arms against their brethren in the occupied territories and neighboring countries."

It's tough for arab engineers to find employment, when many jobs are with defence-related companies, which are closed to Arabs.

### Current Progress

Israel's Arab minority is seeking its share of success in a "startup nation".
- Nazareth is establishing a reputation as a hub of Arab entrepreneurship and innovation
- Startup incubators like the NBIC (Nazareth Business Incubator Center) are trying to attract potential investors to the area and increase the visibility of Arab firms
- At Haifa's Technicon University -- Israel's answer to MIT -- over 20% of undergraduates are Arabic, an 11% rise since 2001
- Takwin Labs in Haifa -- another startup incubator
- The number of Arab engineers at the large Israeli branches of multinational tech companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel, and Microsoft is climbing.
- The potential for a boom is there, in a highly educated generation of Arab scientists and engineers.
- Yet there is **still no success story**, like a company acquired for a large sum. E.g. Maktoob in Jordan, a language portal acquired by Yahoo for 9 million.

### Wider Social Impact

"Entrepreneurs in Nazareth can be the bridge between Israel and 400 million Arabs [around the Middle East]" -- *Palestinian Businessman, Abdul Malik Al Jaber*

Imagine the impact this would have on the peace process (peace negotiations have frozen since April last year).

### Goals

#### => More success stories. More visibility for Arab-led startups. More interest from Investors.


# Case Studies Of Stakeholders

### Startup: [Alpha Omega](https://alphaomega-eng.com/)
 Startup that makes equipment for Neuroscience research founded by Imad and Reem Younis.  Both grew up in Nazareth, relocated to the US to kick-start their company, then returned to Nazareth.
 "The Younises’ big break came in 2000, when Medtronic, the medical device giant, introduced a form of therapy for Parkinson’s disease that involved planting electrodes in the brain. The electrodes had to be directed to just the right spot, and the couple realized that a product they already made could do that. They cobbled together a prototype, flew to the U.S., and drove across the country, hitting all the top brain centers.
By the end of the year they had their first clients, and in 2003 the Younises moved to Atlanta for two years to be closer to the American hospitals that were their primary market. It wasn’t a foregone conclusion that they would move back. But the idea of basing their company in Nazareth was important. “I decided we were doing it the hard way,” Reem says with a laugh. “We were going through the little door, not the wide door.”
The door, in Nazareth, is now wider, thanks in part to the Younises. Today the company takes up one floor of a hulking new office building on an otherwise bare hilltop outside Nazareth. It employs 60 people, and as in the city itself, most are Arab. The company’s “GPS systems for neurosurgeons” are in 500 research labs and hospitals around the world. And, as Reem points out with pride, several former employees have left and started three companies of their own."

### Startup: [Optima Design Automation](http://optima-da.com/)
Software company based in Nazareth.
Develops Electronic Design Automation software tools to solve "soft" errors with electronic chips.
"Optima’s software lets chipmakers calculate exactly where they need to build redundancy into their designs to make their chips less vulnerable. The product is in beta now, and Mazzawi hopes to one day sell it to chip giants such as Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm."
Founder Jamil R. Mazzawi is an experienced engineer and Technicon Computer Science graduate.
"Mazzawi is also an Arab, though, and that makes everything harder. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Nazareth, a mostly Arab city culturally remote from Israel’s social and financial capitals. Having battled his way into the Technion from a largely vocational high school, he struggled to keep up with his better-prepared classmates. When he graduated and first sent out applications for jobs he felt well qualified for, he didn’t hear back from a single employer—a story common among Arab engineers.
"Since starting his company, he’s found it difficult to find advice and funding. “If I was Jewish,” he says, “I would have two or three uncles or friends who have money and who are willing to invest and risk money in order to maybe make money. In Arab society, this culture doesn’t exist of ‘Let’s invest in high tech to make money.’ ”
“They’ll ask certain questions, and to get answers you need to talk to people. **With my limited network, it’s harder to get this information**,” he says. “**That’s what I’m missing**.”

### Co-working space: [Nazareth Business Incubator center](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/p/nazareth-business-incubator-center)
"Situated in the heart of the city of Nazareth, NBIC offers 13 furnished offices that include telecommunications, a lecture area accommodating up to 50 people, and a public space. The benefit package includes business consulting, links to financing channels, and networking. NBIC offers courses, training, and forums related to entrepreneurship, in addition to a pleasant and professional atmosphere."
